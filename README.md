# Plotly
Module 12 Challenge, Creating a dashboard using plotly.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.

## Overview
Create a dashboard to allow Roza to help her users to visualize the bacterial data. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the <b>Top 10</b> bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
